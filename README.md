# NagiosPlugins
Nagios plugins I wrote as part of my printer monitoring internship. Written in Bash. Working for several different printer manufacturers.

toner_levels.sh returns toner level for specified color
paper_level.sh triggers an alert if a printer runs out of paper
pagecounts.sh returns the total B&W and color pages printed
